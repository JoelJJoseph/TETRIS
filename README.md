# TETRIS

To run this file just type python app.py



Inspiration
Alexey Pajitnov, said that, "Tetris is a very simple game, but it appeals to many players because it's both visually and intellectually challenging." “I think that’s what makes the game so addictive. We have an inherent desire to create order out of chaos, and Tetris satisfies that desire on a very basic level, while being easy to understand and quick to learn.” Pajitnov drew inspiration from his favorite puzzle board game, Pentominoes. Instead of using 12 Pentominoes, which are shapes comprised of five squares, Pajitnov chose to design the game using seven distinctive playing pieces made from four squares called Tetriminos.

What it does
The hand is an important part of the human body. It helps us to communicate, to feel the world around us, to feed us, to manipulate objects. Hand traumas or deformities often become a major obstacle in meeting daily tasks for many people around the world. Minor hand trauma is very common and is the subject of 5-10% of visits to the United States emergency department . These wounds in the hand lead to temporary incapacitation. Movement is a crucial factor in regaining the functions of the hand after suffering a trauma, whether the injury requires surgery or not. Usually, these movements must be made as often as possible. Rehabilitation procedures are used to strengthen the muscles of the hand, which restores the functionality of the affected hand .So i created the the old classic game of tetris using hand gestures which helps the mind and also helps in the movement of hand.

How I built it
I build it using Opencv and python and pygame.

Challenges I ran into
Combining the Hand gestures and Tetris was tough job and create a Gui using python was another headache.

Accomplishments that I'm proud of
This is my first project on OpenCV and i got to learn much about it. Being totally new to Hackathons, the implementation of the entire project helped me realize the importance of collaboration and the dynamics of working in a project . In every Hackathon, proper time management plays a crucial role that can become a determining factor for the overall progress; I understood the instrumentality of following the code of conduct and treating fellow developers with respect while learning and improving through their feedback.

What I learned
I learned a lot Opencv and python Gui and about pygame

What's next for Tetris
Try implementing these on other games as well.
